This is where I started my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis with the Incubator

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building 

## Project Topic: E Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

This data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past years. by analysing the various parameters in data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
